Hello! I'm Andrés, currently on my final year as a PhD Student in the statistics department at [Columbia University](https://stat.columbia.edu/), in New York City. I'm co-advised by [Professor Marcel Nutz](https://www.marcelnutz.com/) and [Professor Philip Protter](https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/protter/). My research interests are probability theory & stochastic calculus, with applications to both optimization and statistics. More specifically, I've focused on SDE analysis and random times, mainly explosions and jump times; while recently focusing on Optimal Transport theory, and regularizations therein. 

Before my PhD, I received my Bachelors and Masters degrees at the [Facultad de Ciencias Físicas y Matemáticas (FCFM)](https://ingenieria.uchile.cl/), at [Universidad de Chile](https://uchile.cl/), where I graduated as the best graduate in my cohort. 

I was born and raised in Santiago, Chile. I'm also an avid boardgamer and tabletop roleplaying enthusiast!
